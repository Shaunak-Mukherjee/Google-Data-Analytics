Welcome to the Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study! In this case study, you will perform many real-world tasks of a junior
data analyst. You will work for a fictional company, Cyclistic, and meet different characters and team members. In order to
answer the key business questions, you will follow the steps of the data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze,
share, and act. Along the way, the Case Study Roadmap tables — including guiding questions and key tasks — will help you
stay on the right path.
